# **App Name**: Open for Product

## Core Features:

- Project Publication & Categories: Users create project proposals with clear goals, timelines, and contribution needs. Projects can fall into categories such as: Creative (art, writing, design, media), Technical (software, engineering, product prototypes), Community (social good, mutual aid, neighborhood or local initiatives), Business & Enterprise (startups, service models, operational innovation), Learning & Research (education projects, experiments, shared inquiry).
- Project Discovery & Support: Card-based browsing with filters by category, stage, and contribution type. Community voting and feedback mechanisms. Expert-weighted evaluations and optional AI tool forecasting to help surface viable projects.
- Divergent Learning Paths: Contributors can take “class-like” modules tied to real project work. As milestones are reached, users unlock new industry-aligned learning paths. Paths emphasize transferability—skills gained in one industry open doors in others. Re-Pathing support lets users shift directions without losing progress.
- Contributor Recognition: Badges, certificates, and portfolio entries tied to real projects. Recognition for both direct contribution and passive/learning participation.
- Collaboration Tools: Task boards, progress tracking, messaging. Lightweight governance: community voting, transparent resource allocation, and fair stake distribution.
- AI Assistance: Summarizes project progress and discussions. Highlights blockers and dependencies. Suggests next steps and connects contributors with matching opportunities.
- Value Distribution: Rewards allocated transparently (e.g., 75% to contributors, 10% community stake, 15% sustainability burn). Flexible to project type and governance rules.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant teal `#23BDA8` (innovation, collaboration).
- Background: Light teal `#E0F8F4` (clean, approachable).
- Accent: Seafoam green `#A2E8C9` (for highlights and CTAs). (Optionally, we can extend palette with warm coral or golden accents to differentiate project categories.)
- Typography: Inter sans-serif, clean and versatile.
- Layout: Card-based UI for projects, learning paths, and profiles.
- Icons: Minimalist, friendly, category-specific.
- Animations: Subtle motion cues to guide users through flows and provide feedback.
